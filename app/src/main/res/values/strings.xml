    <string name="content">What can I say? In my opinion, this is the best drama of the year, perhaps the best in a long time, and undoubtedly the finest historical drama. Inspirational adult love story with none of the fluffy stuff. The drama takes you on an emotional with many heart-wrenching moments throughout. While it touches on controversial topics, it deals with them beautifully, sparking diverse opinions. The actors, especially the main leads, were phenomenal. The cinematography, fight scenes, and OST were amazing. Sure, you could point out some flaws in the plot, but lets be honest, most dramas have them.</string>
